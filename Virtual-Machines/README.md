# Virtual Machines - DevOps Zero to Hero

This repository contains my learning notes and practical understanding of Virtual Machines as part of my DevOps journey.

In this section, I focused on understanding the foundation of infrastructure before moving into Docker, Kubernetes, and Cloud platforms.

## Topics Covered

- What is a Server?
- What is a Virtual Machine (VM)?
- What is a Hypervisor?
- Difference between Physical Machine and Virtual Machine
- Advantages of Virtual Machines
- Types of Hypervisors
- VM Architecture
- How to Create a Virtual Machine
- Different Ways to Create Virtual Machines
- Basic Resource Allocation (CPU, RAM, Storage)
- Snapshot Concept
- Real-world DevOps Usage of VMs

## Learning Roadmap (VM Fundamentals)

1. Understand physical servers
2. Understand virtualization concept
3. Learn hypervisors (Type 1 & Type 2)
4. Compare physical vs virtual machines
5. Learn practical VM creation
6. Understand why VMs are important in DevOps & Cloud

## Why This Topic is Important in DevOps

Virtual Machines form the foundation of:

- Cloud computing (EC2, Azure VM, GCP)
- Infrastructure setup
- Test & staging environments
- CI/CD pipelines
- Production deployments

Before containers and Kubernetes, everything runs on Virtual Machines.

## What I Practiced

- Installed virtualization software
- Created a VM manually
- Allocated CPU, RAM and storage
- Installed an operating system inside VM
- Understood snapshot and rollback
- Learned networking basics for VM
