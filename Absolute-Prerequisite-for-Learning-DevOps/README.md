# Absolute Prerequisite for Learning DevOps

This section focuses on understanding how real-world organizations work and where a DevOps engineer fits inside that structure.

Before learning tools like Docker, Kubernetes, or CI/CD, it is important to understand:

- How requirements travel inside a company
- Who creates business requirements
- Who designs the system
- Who implements the features
- How DevOps engineers receive tasks
- How work is tracked using Jira

DevOps is not just about tools.
It is about understanding the entire delivery ecosystem inside an organization.
