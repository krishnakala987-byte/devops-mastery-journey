# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and DevOps Integration

In this section, I studied the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and understood how DevOps integrates into it to improve efficiency and speed.

SDLC is the standard process followed in the software industry to design, develop, test, and deliver software in a structured way.

DevOps does not replace SDLC. Instead, it enhances SDLC by automating and optimizing key phases like building, testing, and deployment.
